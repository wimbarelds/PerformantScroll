# PerformantScroll
Experiment that only renders DOM elements that are on screen. This should improve performance on pages with many items (i.e. hundreds or thousands). Could be combined with lazy-loading if total number of items is known.

Note that this does require that all elements be the same size.
Also note that this is an experiment.

Vue.js was used to handle the view and databinding.
